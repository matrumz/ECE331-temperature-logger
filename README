ECE 331 Spring 2015 Project #2
by Mathew Rumsey

This project is a web-displayed temperature logger. Using Perl scripts and 
i2ctools, raw ADC temperature values are read by a Raspberry Pi, from the 
XMEGA expansion board developed by Andrew Sheaff, via the I2C bus. This 
acquisition occurs every minute, and then the raw data is converted into 
degree F values by the initial Perl script. This calculated value is inserted
into an SQLite database by another Perl script where a PHP script will acquire
24 hours worth of data entries. This PHP script will then generate a .png image
plotting the temperature values acquired by the PHP script. This process is 
entirely automated.
